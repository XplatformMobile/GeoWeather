Wish List for GeoWeather app
===================================

1)	Add a button or icon in the annotation (balloon that pops up when a pushpin is touched) that, when pressed,
	brings up a WebView with the Weather.com weather page for the location (current conditions and a forecast)
	(Workers: JJB JSP)
	[Status: Comments in geo.js (lines 145 to 150) show how this can be done using RESTful web service calls]
	pinnowjs: Haven't found nice RESTful  intereface, but established a webview can be loaded, using weather.gov until thats figured out.
