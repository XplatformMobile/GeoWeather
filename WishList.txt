Wish List for GeoWeather app
===================================

1)	Add a button or icon in the annotation (balloon that pops up when a pushpin is touched) that, when pressed,
	brings up a WebView with the Weather.com weather page for the location (current conditions and a forecast)

	[Status: JJB comments in geo.js (lines 145 to 150) show how this can be done using RESTful web service calls,
			 John has any touch of annotation brings up the MSOE home page in a web view.]
	
2)	App errors in Mobile Web Preview in Browser.

3)	"longpress" (event is handled in map.js) doesn't bring up a new pushpin.

	pinnowjs: Haven't found nice RESTful  intereface, but established a webview can be loaded, using weather.gov until thats figured out.
	
2)	Add a screen that shows all the pushpins locations and brief weather info (temperature, weather icon, maybe time??). Pushpins can be added, sorted, or deleted from this menu.
