Wish List for GeoWeather app
===================================

1)	Add a button or icon in the annotation (balloon that pops up when a pushpin is touched) that, when pressed,
	brings up a WebView with the Weather.com weather page for the location (current conditions and a forecast)
<<<<<<< HEAD
	(Workers: JJB, John)
	[Status: JJB comments in geo.js (lines 145 to 150) show how this can be done using RESTful web service calls,
			 John has any touch of annotation bringing up Weather.gov page (how about Weather.com instead).]
	
2)	App errors in Mobile Web Preview in Browser.

3)	Longpress now works! Thanks to John. We used the new GeoCoder app as a model to use Alloy XML views to connect
	'onLongClick' attribute to a fn. that creates a new pushpin and annotation.
	[Status: DONE]
	
4)	Add a screen that shows all the pushpins locations and brief weather info (temperature, weather icon, maybe time??). Pushpins can be added, sorted, or deleted from this menu.
